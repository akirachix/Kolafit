#Inspiration behind the project.

A key limitation on the eligibility of many assets as collateral is information asymmetry. 
Owing to the inability of many prospective lenders to ascertain with confidence the true ownership of assets, and reluctant to accept many assets that could serve as collateral. 
In many instances, lenders may also lack the capacity to monitor the use of the assets after the credit is disbursed or ascertain completing claims on the said assets.
Leading to the practical difficulties of recovery in the event of default, this informational constraint renders many types of assets ineligible as collateral and limits access to credit.

#Project description

This project aims at improving the creditworthiness of blue collar workers without requiring collateral.
It will be built by KolaFit, Akirachix Software Engineering students based on the problems the blue-collar workers face while trying to access loans from Financial Institutions. 
Most of the blue-collar workers who are potential enough to pay back loans have difficulties in accessing loans due to a lack of collateral and information asymmetry. 
The aim of KolaFit is to improve the creditworthiness of blue-collar workers so as to access loans from the Financial institution.

We decided to build a platform that enables us to collect the usersâ€™ information through a PWA. We store that data and calculate their loan eligibility. 
This will enable the lenders to use an API to tap into our system and get the data.

#Our Users

Blue-collar workers and Financial Institutions.
